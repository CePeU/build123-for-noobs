# build123-for-noobs

These Github pages are for my own documentation of how to use build123d commands.

Documenting your project is a hard task and takes a LOT of time. Also there are different levels of knowgledge of users. Beeing a self thought programmer and having a starting to medium knowledge level I found the build123d documentation lacking. The current documentation is centered on an experienced coder view. Also some explanations do not make enough sense or need more in details for me to understand.

Or to put it in modern film terms. The coders are Neo and I am still caught in the matrix.

So as long as I am caught in the matrix and while I have a different beginners perspective I will try to document my own experiences and explanations.

Some explanations will be surely false and incorrect. Feel free to correct me.

So I will document build123d commands, how to use them, include code snippets and usage examples and probably also cool code examples of real builds which I will try to comment and explain on my own terms.

You find the build123d project at: [https://github.com/gumyr/build123d](https://github.com/gumyr/build123d)

Head over to read all the other documentation (there is a lot!) [https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://build123d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

Do not misunderstand me. The coders and the build123d team does a fantastic job and are super helpfull but their mindset ist not allways mine :)

You can find my documentation here: [https://cepeu.github.io/build123-for-noobs/](https://cepeu.github.io/build123-for-noobs/)

I also hereby grant the permission for the build123d project to use any explanation and code found here to improve their own documentation.

Finally easy fillet! Bang! GREAT! DARN! I need to learn a lot of new commands - hey I am not stupid I can do that! DARN! It's probably wise to use VSCode - I have some experience with it but ... well not much. DARN! I am a noob a few of the documentation examples are not self explanatory enough for me. GREAT! There is a discord out there (and BELIEVE ME these guys there are soooo helpfull) UH! Some of the stuff they tell and teach me I need to understand my own way first - the noob way. So yes I am a noob and they are coders. For coders they are immensely nice but they are Neo in the matrix and I did not (yet!) take the red pill. So I found out that github offers the possibility to host static web sites. Also I have my own unique view on things and how I understand problems. Also learning requires repetition. To be able to repeat you need to document and many times in your own words and explanations. So I decided to set up my own documentation and to share it on the internet - so maybe someone else might also profit. My intention ist to describe code examples and functions in my way which might have a different perspective than someone who is an accomplished coder allready. Beside that as I am a noob there might be \"wrong\" explanations (you know how you explain to your kids the thing about the bees and flowers .. don't you?) and others might be plain wrong (humor me). Otherwise feel free to correct me or make helpfull improvements!","title":"Index"},{"location":"Index/#welcome-to-build123d-noob-help","text":"So I found this cool project build123d on github which allows me to transition from OpenScad to something more powerful.
